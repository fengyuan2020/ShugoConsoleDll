# Aion-Version-Dll
Aion 4.0 No-IP and Windows 10 mouse fix.

New features for 1.4:
- The IP fix now supports Aion 5.8.
- Added `-disable-xigncode` command line option to prevent xigncode from loading. Only tested in 5.8.

New features for 1.3:
- Fix a bug for the windowed mode mouse fix that could make it stop working after moving the window.

New features for 1.2:
- The Windows 10 mouse fix now works for windowed mode.
- Added the option `-win10-mouse-fix-autodetect` which will automatically enable the mouse fix depending on the OS version.

New features for 1.1:
- Added option to enable all graphics options sliders (shadows, water quality, etc) which are otherwise disabled at high resolutions. This feature is enabled by passing the `-unlimited-gfx` command line argument to aion.bin.

Features:
- Allows the game client to connect to the game server IP specified by the -ip:x.x.x.x command line parameter. (Prevents the error message "No game server is available to the authorization server (6)".)
- Fixes the mouse issue on Windows 10 without needing to run a separate program. This feature is enabled by passing the `-win10-mouse-fix` command line argument to aion.bin.
- The IP fix can be disabled with `-disable-ip-fix` in case you only want to use the mouse fix.
